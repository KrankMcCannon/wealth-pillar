## üöÄ Recommended Priority Order

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (Do Next)

#### 1. **PHASE 5: Performance Optimization** (2-3 hours)
**Why**: Improve user experience, reduce load times
```
Steps:
1. Analyze bundle size
2. Implement code splitting (lazy-load Reports, Investments, Settings)
3. Optimize images
4. Review React Query caching

Expected Impact**: 30-50% faster page transitions
```

#### 2. **PHASE 6: Testing Infrastructure** (3-4 hours)
**Why**: Catch bugs early, enable confident refactoring
```
Steps:
1. Set up Jest + React Testing Library
2. Test lib/utils/ and lib/services/ (target 80% coverage)
3. Test critical components and workflows

Expected Impact**: 0 regression bugs, faster development
```

---

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Do After High Priority)

#### 3. **PHASE 8: Type Safety Enhancement** (2-3 hours)
**Why**: Reduce runtime errors, improve developer experience
```
Steps:
1. Replace 40 "any" types with proper types
2. Add API response validation (Zod)
3. Implement strict TypeScript mode

Expected Impact**: Better IDE support, self-documenting code
```

#### 4. **PHASE 7: Documentation** (2 hours)
**Why**: Help new developers, preserve institutional knowledge
```
Steps:
1. Update ARCHITECTURE.md with new structure
2. Create SETUP.md for local development
3. Document common patterns and workflows

Expected Impact**: Faster onboarding for new team members
```

---

### **LOW PRIORITY** (Consider Later)

#### 5. **PHASE 9: Feature Enhancements**
**Suggested Features**:
- CSV/PDF export for transactions and reports
- Budget limit notifications
- Spending trend analysis
- Multi-currency support
- Mobile app (React Native)

---

## ‚ú® Quick Wins (< 30 minutes each)

1. **Reduce ESLint Errors**
   - Replace most critical "any" types
   - Run: `npm run lint` to identify top offenders

2. **Add Error Boundary Component**
   - Wrap dashboard pages with error boundaries
   - Better error handling for users

3. **Implement Loading States**
   - Create consistent LoadingSpinner component
   - Use in data-fetching scenarios

4. **Add Favicon & Metadata**
   - Add app icon
   - Add SEO metadata to pages

---

## üìã Questions for Product/Design Team

Before implementing Phase 9 (Feature Enhancements), clarify:

1. **What's the priority for new features?**
   - Data export?
   - Notifications?
   - Analytics?
   - Mobile app?

2. **What metrics matter most?**
   - User engagement?
   - Feature adoption?
   - Performance?

3. **Any planned integrations?**
   - Bank APIs?
   - Payment processors?
   - Analytics platforms?

4. **Timeline constraints?**
   - When is the next release planned?
   - Any hard deadlines?

---

## üîß How to Get Started on Phase 5

```bash
# 1. Check current bundle size
npm run build
# Look for: "Total size" in build output

# 2. Find largest files
find .next/static -name "*.js" -size +50k

# 3. Implement code splitting for Reports page
# Example: const Reports = lazy(() => import('@/src/features/reports'))

# 4. Measure improvement
npm run build
# Compare file sizes before/after
```
