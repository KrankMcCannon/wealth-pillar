description: Check and enforce UX/UI style consistency
---

This workflow ensures that the UI components and styles adhere to the project's established UX/UI guidelines.

1.  **Identify Context**:
    - Determine which UI components or pages are being modified.
    - Locate the project's design tokens.

2.  **Check Consistency**:
    - **Colors**: Verify matches with project variables (`bg-primary` vs `#123`).
    - **Typography**: Check fonts, sizes, and weights.
    - **Spacing**: Ensure margins/paddings follow the scale.
    - **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-first approach. Check that the UI adapts to smaller screens.

3.  **Enforce Rules**:
    - IF styles are inconsistent:
        - Suggest changes to align with the style guide.
    - IF a new pattern is introduced:
        - Flag it.

4.  **Action**:
    - Apply corrections or list violations.
