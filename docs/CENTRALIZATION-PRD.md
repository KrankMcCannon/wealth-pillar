# WEALTH PILLAR CODEBASE CENTRALIZATION PRD
**Version**: 2.0
**Status**: PHASE 1 ✅ COMPLETE | PHASE 2 IN PROGRESS
**Date**: October 24, 2025

---

## PHASE 1 - BUILD FIX ✅ COMPLETE

**What was done**:
- ✅ Fixed all app/api routes to use @/src/lib paths (28 files)
- ✅ Created 4 missing feature index.ts files
- ✅ Created src/components/index.ts
- ✅ Fixed src/lib/database/index.ts server-only exports
- ✅ Added 'use client' to client-side hooks
- ✅ Build passes: Compiled successfully in 11.5s

## PHASE 2: LOGIC CENTRALIZATION - COMPLETE ✅

**Goal**: Single source of truth for all utilities, services, and hooks
**Time**: 4-6 hours
**Status**: ✅ ALL STEPS COMPLETE

### Summary:
The codebase was ALREADY well-organized! Each step revealed that consolidation had been done correctly:
- ✅ Form services: Centralized in lib/services/
- ✅ Business logic: Well-organized in lib/services/
- ✅ Utilities: Consolidated in lib/utils/shared.ts
- ✅ Hooks: Properly distributed (shared in lib/, feature-specific in features/)
- ✅ No duplicate code found

**Result**: Phase 2 verified that logic is already optimally organized!

### STEP 2.1: Audit Current State
**Time**: 30 minutes
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**To Do**:
1. List all files in src/lib/services/
2. List all files in src/lib/utils/
3. List all files in src/lib/hooks/
4. Find duplicates in features/*/hooks/ and features/*/services/

**Commands to run**:
```bash
ls -la src/lib/services/
ls -la src/lib/utils/
ls -la src/lib/hooks/
find src/features -name "*.service.ts" | sort
find src/features -name "use*.ts" | sort
```

**Findings**:

**src/lib/services/** (7 files):
1. chart-data.service.ts - Chart data generation
2. data-grouping.service.ts - Data grouping logic
3. financial-calculations.service.ts - Financial math
4. form-state.service.ts - Form state management
5. form-validation.service.ts - Form validation rules
6. transaction-filtering.service.ts - Transaction filtering
7. index.ts - Barrel export

**src/lib/utils/** (4 files):
1. card-utils.ts - Card rendering utilities
2. shared.ts - Shared utility functions
3. ui-variants.ts - CVA style variants
4. index.ts - Barrel export

**src/lib/hooks/** (8 files):
1. use-card-actions.ts - Card interaction hooks

5. use-permissions.ts - Permission checking
6. use-query-hooks.ts - React Query hooks
7. use-user-selection.ts - User selection logic
8. index.ts - Barrel export

**Feature Services** (2 files - mostly centralized):
- budgets/services/budget-calculations.service.ts (can move to lib/services/)
- recurring/services/recurring-execution.service.ts (can move to lib/services/)

**Feature Hooks** (26 files - mostly feature-specific):
- Controllers (form, page): keep in features (feature-specific)
- Mutations (budget, category, transaction): keep in features (feature-specific)
- Auth hooks: keep in features (all auth-specific)

**Status**: ✅ Audit complete - ready for consolidation phases

- ✅ Exported in lib/services/index.ts

**Result**: ALREADY fully centralized! No changes needed. ✅

---

### STEP 2.3: Consolidate Business Logic
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Findings**:

  4. chart-data.service.ts - Chart data preparation
  5. form-validation.service.ts - Already covered in Step 2.2
  6. form-state.service.ts - Already covered in Step 2.2

- ✅ Feature services (domain-specific):
