# Wealth Pillar - Codebase Centralization Project

**Current Status**: PHASE 1 COMPLETE ✅ - PHASE 2 STARTING NEXT

---

## Quick Summary

The Wealth Pillar codebase has been successfully migrated from a scattered structure to a clean `src/` folder organization. **Phase 1** (Build Fix) is complete with a working build. We're now ready to **Phase 2** (Logic Centralization) to eliminate redundancy.

## Project Goals (All Will Be Met)

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Build working (DONE)
- ⏳ **Phase 2**: Centralize logic & utilities (NEXT)
- ⏳ **Phase 3**: Consolidate components & styles
- ⏳ **Phase 4**: Delete redundant code & finalize

**Final Result**:
- Single source of truth for all logic
- No duplicate code
- Centralized components, styles, behaviors
- Clean, maintainable codebase

## Import Standards (ALWAYS USE)

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - From src/ (modern structure)
import { Button } from '@/src/components/ui/button';
import { useTransactions } from '@/src/lib/hooks';
import { PageLayout } from '@/src/components';

// ❌ WRONG - Old paths (will fail)
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { useTransactions } from '@/hooks';
```

## Next Steps to Begin Tomorrow

1. Read **PHASE-1-COMPLETION.md** (understand what was done)
2. Open **CENTRALIZATION-PRD.md** and find "PHASE 2.1"
3. Follow the checklist exactly
4. Update the PRD with your progress
5. Move to next step when done

## Questions About the Current State?

- **Where are the fixes documented?** → PHASE-1-COMPLETION.md
- **What's the full task list?** → CENTRALIZATION-PRD.md
- **Which files changed?** → PHASE-1-COMPLETION.md ("Files Modified" section)
- **Why did we make these changes?** → CENTRALIZATION-PRD.md (top sections)
- **Is the build working?** → Yes! ✅ Compiled successfully

---

## Time Tracking

**Phase 1**: 1 hour ✅
**Phase 2** (next): Est. 4-6 hours
**Phase 3**: Est. 4-6 hours
**Phase 4**: Est. 1-2 hours

**Total remaining**: ~10-15 hours

## Good Luck! 🚀

Everything is set up for success. The build is clean, imports are consistent, and detailed instructions are waiting for you.

**You've got this!**
